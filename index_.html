      Welcome to my home page!<br><br>

      I develop computational frameworks to study various real-world
      problems that can be characterized by complex interactions between
      multiple entities.  My prominent application areas include public
      health, agriculture and social sciences.  With my current research
      centered around the science and engineering of network dynamical
      systems, I construct realistic synthetic datasets (like digital
      twins) and simulation models, apply machine learning & optimization
      algorithms for various computational problems that arise in the
      target applications, and contribute to the theoretical foundations of
      these systems. My work, often carried out in interdisciplinary team
      environments, has been supported by multiple agencies over the years,
      including leadership roles in USDA- and USAID-funded projects.
      Broadly, my research spans the following areas in computational
      sciences: network science, data analytics, algorithm design,
      combinatorics, machine learning, and game theory.
