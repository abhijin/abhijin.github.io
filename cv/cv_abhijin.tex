\textbf{Research Associate Professor} \hfill 2022 -- \\
Network Systems Science and Advanced Computing (NSSAC)\\

%%%%
\section{\textnormal{\textsc{Research interests and Focus}}}
I develop computational frameworks to study complex systems that arise from
large-scale interactions across domains such as infectious disease
dynamics, socio-environmental resilience, agriculture, and social systems.
My work draws on and contributes to network science, simulation modeling,
algorithm design, and machine learning. Central to my research are the
development of realistic synthetic datasets (like digital twins) and
data-driven simulation models, the design of domain-informed algorithms,
and the advancement of theoretical foundations underlying these complex
systems. Much of my work takes place in interdisciplinary team environments
and has been supported by multiple funding agencies. I have led USDA- and
USAID-funded projects that address real-world socio-technical challenges.\\

%% Broadly, my interests are in network science, data science, algorithm
%% design, combinatorics, machine learning and game theory. My current focus
%% is on studying diffusion processes using network dynamical systems and
%% machine learning with application to the spread of invasive species,
%% infectious diseases, and other socio-technical phenomena. There are three
%% main thrusts to my research.  Through large collaborative efforts, I design
%% and analyze data- and process-driven models using domain-specific
%% knowledge. Secondly, I strive to advance the theoretical foundations of
%% such models to create robust models that can be applied in data-poor
%% environments. Thirdly, I develop efficient practical solutions with
%% provable guarantees for various computational problems that arise in the
%% target applications.\\

\section{\textnormal{\textsc{Programmatic contributions}}}
\begin{enumerate}[$\circ$]
\item As PI and Co-PI of the USAID and USDA projects, I have led the
research in the area of invasive species modeling. This includes
collaborating with people from multiple domains and countries (France,
Senegal, India, Nepal, Bangladesh, and US), presenting in annual meetings,
data exploration, providing content for news reports, mentoring students,
and preparing annual reports. It has resulted in publications in top venues
including Proceedings of the Royal Society Biology, Journal of Pest
Science, Journal of Crop Protection and IEEE BigData conference.
\item COVID-19 response: I led the modeling and development of certain
modules in the synthetic population generation pipeline. This work has
contributed to the generation of US domestic networks as well as global
networks. Also, I developed a network analysis tool set, which is used to
validate our networks and for comparative analysis. These tools have been
applied (i)~to provide weekly inputs to various agencies during certain
periods of the year 2020-21, and (ii)~in manuscripts submitted/under
preparation.
\item DARPA NGS2: I contributed significantly to the theoretical aspects of
this project. Our work on inferring graphical dynamical systems has
resulted in five publications in top AI venues and several workshop
presentations.
\item Simulation analytics framework: \textcolor{red}{PENDING}
\item Fall armyworm in Egypt: In a collaborative effort, I led the modeling
effort to assess the possible spread of Fall armyworm in Egypt. This was
funded by USAID mission in Egypt.
\item Participated in a number of proposal writing efforts every year.
\end{enumerate}

\section{\textnormal{\textsc{Software and Datasets}}}
\begin{enumerate}[$\circ$]
\item Multi-pathway simulator: I have led the development of a simulation
framework to study the multi-pathway spread of invasive species. It
consists of a simulator of a generic network diffusion process implemented
using vectorized methods in Python, a multi-scale temporal network module,
implementation of algorithms for calibration and interventions, modules for
model space exploration using computing clusters, regression tests, and various
visualization tools. Domestic trade networks have been constructed for
several countries using multiple datasets and expert knowledge. The
resulting simulation framework has been applied in multiple studies. The
simulator and synthetic datasets are publicly available and are constantly
updated.
\item High-resolution synthetic population models and datasets: Our group
(NSSAC) has been synthesizing highly-detailed population models from
multiple data sources for more than~15 years. Over the years, these
datasets have been applied in epidemiology (COVID-19, Ebola, influenza,
malaria, etc.), transportation, disaster preparedness, resilience and
sustainability. I have played a prominent part in the Biocomplexity
Institute's COVID-19 response on the modeling and development of the
synthetic population networks. I co-led the design and implementation of
the physical contact network construction module. I applied concepts from
geometric intersection graphs and parallelization to speed up the network
generation. I have also developed a tool for analyzing the generated
networks. It has been regularly applied to compare different networks,
visualize, and validate our models. This software has been well integrated
in to our synthetic population pipeline.
\item Deep learning and remote sensing: We have developed a convolutional
neural network (CNN) framework to predict the distribution of invasive
plants using multispectral satellite images and field survey data.  Our
robust training and evaluation framework employs multiple hold-out approach
for model selection and transfer learning to cope with data challenges
imposed by field survey and imagery constraints.  Multi-spectral
remote-sensed images from multiple satellites were used in this study. We
have developed the framework for optical calibration, sharpening, and
interpolation of the images towards feature vector extraction. Popular
deep neural networks had to be adapted for satellite images. Transfer
learning approaches were applied. The framework is applied to study the
distribution of multiple invasive plants in the Chitwan-Annapurna Landscape
of Nepal, a biodiversity hotspot.
\end{enumerate}

\section{\textnormal{\textsc{Transdisciplinary team science}}}
My work involves leading and being part of large teams of researchers from
different fields.  As PI of two USAID and USDA projects, I have led BII’s
research in the area of invasive species modeling. As PI, I have initiated
multiple projects collaborating with researchers from several countries
(US, France, Senegal, India, Nepal, and Bangladesh). Example projects
include (i)~modeling the spread of a pest of the tomato plant, \tutafull{} in
Southeast Asia and West Africa involving entomologists, economists,
modelers and computer scientists and (ii)~mapping invasive plants in Nepal
using remote-sensing and machine learning involving botanists and
geoinformation specialists. I play a major role is several large team projects in the
Biocomplexity Institute as well. These include studies related to
computational epidemiology such as COVID-19 response, disaster
preparedness, and computational social science.
