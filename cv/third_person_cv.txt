Abhijin Adiga is a research associate professor at the Biocomplexity Institute, University of Virginia. He develops computational frameworks to study complex systems that emerge from large-scale interactions across diverse domains, including infectious disease dynamics, socio-environmental resilience, agriculture, and other socio-technical systems. Central to his research are the development of realistic synthetic datasets (like digital twins) and data-driven simulation models, the design of domain-informed algorithms, and the advancement of theoretical foundations underlying these complex systems. This research draws on and contributes to network science, simulation modeling, machine learning, algorithm design, and game theory. Much of his work is conducted in interdisciplinary team environments and has been supported by multiple funding agencies. He has led USDA- and USAID-funded projects focused on addressing real-world socio-technical challenges.
