Abhijin Adiga is a research associate professor at the Biocomplexity Institute, University of Virginia. He develops computational frameworks to study complex systems that emerge from large-scale interactions across diverse domains such as infectious disease dynamics, socio-environmental resilience, and agriculture. Central to his research are the development of realistic in silico representations (digital twins and simulators), domain-informed algorithms, and the theoretical foundations of these complex systems. This research draws on and contributes to network science, modeling and simulation analytics, machine learning, algorithm design, and game theory. Much of his work is conducted in interdisciplinary team environments and has been supported by multiple funding agencies. He has led USDA- and USAID-funded projects focused on addressing real-world socio-technical challenges.
