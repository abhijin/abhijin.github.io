\section{\textnormal{{Current job}}}\label{sec:currentJob}
My work is in the area of mathematical foundations of big data and network science with
focus on graph dynamical systems, algorithm design, graph theoretical
analysis and modeling which have diverse applications in
technological, social and biological systems. Through collaborative
efforts, I analyze and develop algorithms for solving
combinatorial problems that arise out of the study of such systems.

\section{\textnormal{{Postdoctoral associate}}}\label{sec:postdoc}
(October 2011 -- May 2014) Job description is same as current
job.\smallskip

\section{\textnormal{{Research associate}}}
(March 2011 to October 2011) I continued my PhD work.\smallskip

\section{\textnormal{PhD}}
(August 2006 to March 2011)
The work of this thesis falls into the broad area of theoretical computer
science, and in particular, concerns graph theory, combinatorics and
algorithms. We study some geometric representations of graphs and
dimensional properties of graphs and posets. The main objective is
to represent a graph using certain geometric objects. Many problems
on graphs which are otherwise computationally hard to solve can be
solved efficiently if the graph in consideration has a simple geometric
representation. In the parlance of theoretical computer science, many
NP-hard problems may be either solved in polynomial time or at least
have good approximation algorithms when a graph has a low dimensional
geometric representation. Besides, the representations which we consider
have applications in various other scientific disciplines: ecology,
social sciences, psychology, telecommunication and operations research.
Our contribution to this area are as follows:
(1)~We have developed efficient algorithms to
obtain such representations for certain specific classes of graphs.
(2)~We have complexity results which show that for some classes of graphs, it
is computationally hard to obtain such a representation.
(3)~We give a general framework relating different representations.

\section{\textnormal{Beceem Communications}}\label{sec:beceem}
(August 2004 -- July 2006)
I was part of the algorithm development and simulation group. My
work involved the design and implementation of algorithms for WiMax
(802.16), a wireless broadband standard. I worked on (1)~implementing
and maintaining the error control coding module in the simulator, 
%I had
%to implement the turbo encoder and decoder, a class of high-performance
%forward error correction (FEC) codes. The language in which the simulator
%was implemented was MATLAB.
(2)~The creation of an interface between
the simulator (coded in MATLAB) and the chip (coded using Verilog), 
%I was involved in this project right from its initiation. This interface
%provided the vital link between the two modules and enabled the
%verification.
(3)~Running simulations by
varying parameters such as type of codec, channel, etc.

\section{\textnormal{Project associate}}\label{sec:dataMining}
(October 2003 to April 2004)
The work was in the area of temporal data-mining. 
%We were given access
%to months of data from a manufacturing line of a factory. Each time
%the manufacturing process stopped, the time and the reason behind
%the stoppage was logged into the system. The reasons could be anything
%ranging from the mundane (like a lunch break!) to the very technical ones.
%Each possible reason for stoppage was represented by a symbol. Hence,
%the data given to us was in the form of very long sequences of symbols
%with time stamp. 
The aim was to extract interesting patterns from a sequence of logs
obtained from a manufacturing process by using machine learning techniques.
%The main question
%that our tool had to answer was: Does a particular sequence of breakdowns
%in one section of the manufacturing line influence a breakdown in some
%other section?
%My work was mainly implementation oriented and could be divided into two
%parts.  Firstly, 
I helped in the development of the data mining tools for this purpose.
%to filter the data 
%(like
%for example, removing the symbols corresponding to lunch break). This
%required using some scripting languages. Secondly, 
%I had to assist in
%enhancing our data mining tool by implementing new search techniques. The
%language of implementation was C.
%
%I was also involved in administrative activities related to the project and
%conducting exams.

\section{\textnormal{MSc}}\label{sec:mastersAbstract}
(August 2001 to September 2003)
%This work is in the area of digital signal processing. 
We proposed a
framework for implementing wavelet transforms in the frequency domain
particularly for application on images and analyzed the performance of our
methods in the context of image compression by comparing our methods with
the methods used in JPEG and JPEG 2000 image compression
standards. 
%%
\section{\textnormal{Project associate}}\label{sec:turbo}
(October 2000 -- August 2001)
I worked in the area of communication theory. My work involved studying
the area of joint source and channel coding and other areas related to
telecommunication. I implemented some algorithms like turbo codecs and
Rijndael in MATLAB and helped in administrative activities.
